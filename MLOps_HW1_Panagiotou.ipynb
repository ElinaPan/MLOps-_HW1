    "- небольшой размер → удобно версионировать в DVC;  \n",

    "Цель проекта — построить минимальный, но полноценный MLOps-контур для задачи классификации:\n",
    "\n",
    "- обеспечить **воспроизводимость экспериментов**;\n",
    "- настроить **версионирование данных** через DVC;\n",
    "- автоматизировать процесс подготовки данных и обучения модели с помощью **DVC-пайплайна**;\n",
    "- логировать **гиперпараметры, метрики и артефакты модели** в MLflow;\n",
    "- запускать всё обучение одной командой `dvc repro`.\n",

    "Проект использует небольшой классический датасет **Iris** (многоклассовая классификация трёх видов ирисов) и модель **логистической регрессии**.\n",

    "## Описание датасета\n",
    "\n",
    "В качестве демонстрационного датасета используется **Iris** (из библиотеки `scikit-learn`):\n",
    "\n",
    "- 150 объектов (цветы ириса),\n",
    "- 4 числовых признака:\n",
    "  - sepal length (cm) — длина чашелистика,\n",
    "  - sepal width (cm) — ширина чашелистика,\n",
    "  - petal length (cm) — длина лепестка,\n",
    "  - petal width (cm) — ширина лепестка,\n",
    "- целевая переменная `target` — вид ириса: *setosa*, *versicolor*, *virginica* (3 класса).\n",
    "\n",
    "Датасет небольшой, чистый и стандартизованный, поэтому хорошо подходит для учебной задачи по построению воспроизводимого ML-пайплайна и демонстрации работы DVC и MLflow.\n",

    "## Проверка воспроизводимости пайплайна\n",
    "\n",
    "Чтобы убедиться, что созданный ML-пайплайн полностью воспроизводим, я смоделировала запуск проекта в новой, «чистой» среде. Для этого были выполнены следующие шаги.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Клонирование репозитория\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone <https://github.com/ElinaPan/MLOps-_HW1>\n",
    "cd <C:\\Users\\Elina\\Desktop\\Master\\обучение\\ТРЕТИЙ СЕМЕСТР\\MLOps\\test_HW1>\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Установка зависимостей\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Восстановление данных через DVC\n",
    "\n",
    "Поскольку данные находятся под управлением DVC и хранятся в заранее настроенном локальном remote-хранилище, достаточно выполнить команду:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dvc pull\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "После её выполнения в рабочей директории автоматически появились:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `data/raw/data.csv`\n",
    "* `data/processed/train.csv`\n",
    "* `data/processed/test.csv`\n",
    "* `model.pkl`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Воспроизведение всего пайплайна\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "dvc repro\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Вывод DVC:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "'data\\raw\\data.csv.dvc' didn't change, skipping\n",
    "Stage 'prepare' didn't change, skipping\n",
    "Stage 'train' didn't change, skipping\n",
    "Data and pipelines are up to date.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Этот вывод означает, что:\n",
    "\n",
    "* артефакты полностью соответствуют описанным в `dvc.lock`,\n",
    "* стадии `prepare` и `train` не требуют пересборки,\n",
    "* данные и код находятся в строгом соответствии с зафиксированной ранее версией пайплайна.\n",
    "\n",
    "Это подтверждает корректность и воспроизводимость проекта.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Итог\n",
    "\n",
    "Проект полностью воспроизводим:\n",
    "после выполнения последовательности команд\n",
    "**`git clone → pip install → dvc pull → dvc repro`**\n",
    "получаются те же подготовленные данные, результаты обучения, артефакты и метрики.\n",
    "\n",
    "Это соответствует требованиям задания и демонстрирует корректную настройку DVC-пайплайна и MLflow.\n",
    "\n"
